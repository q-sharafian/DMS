When you have an interface and functions that use it as an argument, Go's interface mechanism inherently ensures that you're working with a *reference* to the underlying concrete type, not a copy. This means that all functions receiving that interface argument will refer to the same instance of the underlying type.

Here's how it works and how to ensure that you're not accidentally creating copies:

**1. Interfaces are Implicit Pointers:**

* In Go, interfaces are implemented as a pair of pointers:
    * One pointer points to the type information (the concrete type).
    * The other pointer points to the actual data (the instance of the concrete type).
* When you pass an interface as an argument, you're essentially passing these two pointers.
* Therefore, all functions that receive the interface argument are working with the same underlying data.

**2. Passing by Interface:**

* When you pass a value that implements an interface as a function argument, Go automatically creates an interface value that points to the original data.
* This avoids copying the data.

**3. Using Pointers to the Concrete Type (Optional but Common):**

* While interfaces are implicitly pointers, it's often common to use pointers to the concrete type that implements the interface.
* This ensures that any modifications made through the interface or through the pointer will affect the same underlying data.
* This is especially useful when the concrete type is a struct or a large data structure.

**Example:**

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type MyInterface interface {
        ModifyValue(newValue int)
        GetValue() int
}

type MyStruct struct {
        value int
}

func (ms *MyStruct) ModifyValue(newValue int) {
        ms.value = newValue
}

func (ms *MyStruct) GetValue() int {
        return ms.value
}

func function1(i MyInterface) {
        i.ModifyValue(100)
        fmt.Println("Function 1:", i.GetValue())
}

func function2(i MyInterface) {
        i.ModifyValue(200)
        fmt.Println("Function 2:", i.GetValue())
}

func main() {
        myStruct := &MyStruct{value: 10} // Using a pointer to MyStruct
        function1(myStruct)
        function2(myStruct)
        fmt.Println("Main:", myStruct.GetValue())
}
```

**Output:**

```
Function 1: 100
Function 2: 200
Main: 200
```

**Explanation:**

* **`MyInterface`:** Defines the interface.
* **`MyStruct`:** Implements the interface using pointer receivers (`*MyStruct`).
* **`function1` and `function2`:** Both functions take `MyInterface` as an argument.
* **`main`:**
    * Creates a *pointer* to `MyStruct` (`&MyStruct{value: 10}`).
    * Passes the pointer to `function1` and `function2`.
* **No Copying:**
    * Both `function1` and `function2` are working with the same underlying `MyStruct` instance because they are working with the interface, which points to the struct.
    * The modifications made in `function1` are reflected in `function2` and in `main`.

**Key Takeaways:**

* Interfaces in Go are designed to work with references, not copies.
* Using pointers to the concrete type that implements the interface is a common and recommended practice.
* This ensures that all functions receiving the interface argument are working with the same underlying data.
