SQL table field (column) naming conventions vary depending on the database system, organization, and personal preferences. However, some common and widely accepted practices exist. Here's a breakdown of recommended naming conventions:

**General Principles:**

* **Descriptive and Meaningful:**
    * Field names should clearly indicate the data they store.
    * Avoid cryptic or ambiguous names.
* **Consistency:**
    * Use a consistent naming style throughout your database.
    * This improves readability and maintainability.
* **Readability:**
    * Choose names that are easy to read and understand.
    * Avoid overly long or complex names.
* **Avoid Reserved Words:**
    * Don't use SQL reserved words (e.g., `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`) as field names.
    * If you must, use quoting or a prefix/suffix.
* **Case Sensitivity:**
    * While some database systems are case-sensitive, it's generally recommended to use lowercase or snake\_case to avoid potential issues.

**Common Naming Styles:**

1.  **Snake Case (Recommended):**
    * Words are separated by underscores (`_`).
    * All letters are lowercase.
    * Example: `first_name`, `order_date`, `product_id`.
    * This is widely considered the most readable and consistent style.

2.  **Camel Case (Less Common):**
    * Words are concatenated, with the first word lowercase and subsequent words capitalized.
    * Example: `firstName`, `orderDate`, `productId`.
    * While used in some environments, it's less common in SQL databases.

3.  **Uppercase with Underscores (Legacy):**
    * All letters are uppercase, and words are separated by underscores.
    * Example: `FIRST_NAME`, `ORDER_DATE`, `PRODUCT_ID`.
    * This style is sometimes used in older systems or legacy databases. It's generally not recommended for new projects.

**Specific Recommendations:**

* **Primary Keys:**
    * Often named `id` or `<table_name>_id` (e.g., `user_id`, `product_id`).
    * Consider using `uuid` or `guid` data types for globally unique identifiers.
* **Foreign Keys:**
    * Use the same naming convention as the primary key in the referenced table.
    * Example: If the primary key in the `products` table is `product_id`, the foreign key in the `orders` table should also be `product_id`.
* **Boolean Fields:**
    * Use names that clearly indicate a true/false value.
    * Example: `is_active`, `has_permission`.
* **Date and Time Fields:**
    * Use names that clearly indicate the type of date/time information.
    * Example: `created_at`, `updated_at`, `order_date`.
* **Avoid Abbreviations:**
    * Unless the abbreviation is widely understood, use full words.
    * Example: Use `customer_address` instead of `cust_addr`.

**Database-Specific Considerations:**

* Some databases have stricter naming rules or limitations on character length. Consult your database's documentation for specific guidelines.

**In summary:**

For most new SQL database designs, snake\_case is the generally recommended and widely accepted naming convention for table fields. It prioritizes readability, consistency, and avoids potential issues with case sensitivity.
