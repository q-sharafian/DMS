When a Redis cache becomes full, you need a strategy to evict (remove) older or less frequently used data to make room for new data. Redis provides several eviction policies to handle this situation. Here's a breakdown of suitable methods and considerations:

**Redis Eviction Policies:**

Redis offers these eviction policies, which you can configure in your `redis.conf` file or via the `CONFIG SET maxmemory-policy` command:

* **`noeviction`:**
    * Returns an error when memory is full and a write operation is attempted.
    * This is generally not suitable for a cache, as it can lead to application errors.
* **`volatile-lru`:**
    * Removes the least recently used (LRU) keys with an expire set.
    * Suitable if you want to evict only keys with a TTL (time-to-live).
* **`allkeys-lru`:**
    * Removes the least recently used (LRU) keys among all keys.
    * A good general-purpose eviction policy for caches.
* **`volatile-lfu`:**
    * Removes the least frequently used keys with an expire set.
* **`allkeys-lfu`:**
    * Removes the least frequently used keys among all keys.
* **`volatile-random`:**
    * Removes a random key with an expire set.
* **`allkeys-random`:**
    * Removes a random key among all keys.
* **`volatile-ttl`:**
    * Removes the keys with the shortest TTL.

**Suitable Methods:**

1.  **`allkeys-lru` (Recommended for General Caching):**
    * This is often the most suitable policy for general caching scenarios.
    * It ensures that the least recently used data is evicted, keeping the most relevant data in the cache.
    * It does not rely on TTLs, so it works even if you don't set expirations on your keys.
2.  **`allkeys-lfu`:**
    * This policy evicts the least frequently used keys. This method is better than lru when there is a lot of data, that is used rarely, but once.
3.  **`volatile-lru` or `volatile-ttl` (If Using TTLs):**
    * If you're using TTLs to expire keys, these policies can be useful.
    * They limit eviction to keys with expirations, which can be desirable in certain scenarios.
4.  **`maxmemory` Configuration:**
    * Along with the eviction policy, you need to set the `maxmemory` configuration option to specify the maximum amount of memory Redis can use for data.
    * example: `CONFIG SET maxmemory 100MB`

**How to Configure:**

1.  **`redis.conf` File:**
    * Edit your `redis.conf` file and set the `maxmemory` and `maxmemory-policy` options.
    * Restart the Redis server for the changes to take effect.
2.  **`CONFIG SET` Command:**
    * Use the `CONFIG SET` command to dynamically change the `maxmemory` and `maxmemory-policy` options while the Redis server is running.
    * example:
        ```bash
        redis-cli CONFIG SET maxmemory 100MB
        redis-cli CONFIG SET maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru
        ```

**Example (Go Code):**

```go
package main

import (
        "context"
        "fmt"
        "log"

        "github.com/redis/go-redis/v9"
)

func main() {
        ctx := context.Background()

        rdb := redis.NewClient(&redis.Options{
                Addr:     "localhost:6379",
                Password: "", // no password set
                DB:       0,  // use default DB
        })

        // Set maxmemory and eviction policy
        err := rdb.ConfigSet(ctx, "maxmemory", "100MB").Err()
        if err != nil {
                log.Fatalf("Error setting maxmemory: %v", err)
        }

        err = rdb.ConfigSet(ctx, "maxmemory-policy", "allkeys-lru").Err()
        if err != nil {
                log.Fatalf("Error setting maxmemory-policy: %v", err)
        }

        fmt.Println("Redis cache configured")
}
```

**Key Considerations:**

* **Memory Usage Monitoring:**
    * Monitor Redis memory usage to ensure that the eviction policy is working effectively.
* **Data Importance:**
    * Choose an eviction policy that aligns with the importance of your cached data.
* **TTL Usage:**
    * If you're using TTLs, consider policies that take them into account.
* **Performance:**
    * Eviction policies can have a slight performance impact. Test and profile your application to ensure that the chosen policy meets your performance requirements.
